//Morning Lab:
//	Write a Java program that display the larger of two integers
//	 Write an if/else statement for the following requirements:
//	If student gets 90 or higher: console log  A
//	If students get 80 or above: console log B
//	If students get 70 or above: console log C
//	If students get 55 or above: console log D
//	Any grade lower than 55 is F
//	 Write a java  program that displays "Good Morning" 
//	 if time is between 5AM-11:59 | "Good Afternoon" if time is between 12 - 16 | otherwise "Hey there"

//Afternoon Lab:
//	Using a while loop, print each char of a string ‘Hello World’
//	Java Program to find duplicate characters in a String
//	 Use a while loop to add up the numbers 1 to 20 into one variable. Print out the sum at the end
//	 Use a while loop to print out the even number from 1 to 20. (You'll need Modulus for this. And an IF Statement.) 
//	 Write a for loop for the given output:
//	 1, 3, 5, 7, 9
//	 2, 4, 6, 8, 10
//	 write a for loop that iterates between 0 and 10 and prints all even numbers. HINT: Read on Module/Remainder operator. 
//	 Write a for loop that iterates from 1 - 20. Prints “prime” for all prime numbers, “even” for all even numbers, and “odd” 
//	 for all odd numbers. Treat 2 as an even number and 1 & 3 as odd
